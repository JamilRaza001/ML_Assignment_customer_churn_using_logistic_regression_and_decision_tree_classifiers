### Direct Answer

- **Key Points**:  
  The code in "Assignment05.ipynb" predicts customer churn using logistic regression and decision tree classifiers, but both models perform poorly, with accuracies around 48-54%. Research suggests the low performance may stem from unscaled features and lack of model tuning, though the dataset is clean and nearly balanced.

#### Data Loading and Exploration  
The notebook starts by loading "customer_churn_data.csv," a dataset with 5,880 rows and 21 columns, including customer details like tenure and monthly charges, and the target variable `Churn` (Yes/No). It checks for missing values, duplicates, and data types, confirming the data is clean with no issues.

#### Preprocessing and Modeling  
The code preprocesses by encoding categorical variables, simplifying some categories (e.g., mapping "No phone service" to "No"), and splitting data into 70% training and 30% testing. It trains logistic regression and a decision tree (with max_depth=5), evaluating both on the training set, with test evaluation only for logistic regression.

#### Performance and Issues  
Both models show low accuracy (52% for logistic regression training, 48% test; 54% for decision tree training), suggesting poor generalization. Potential issues include unscaled numerical features and lack of feature selection, with recommendations for improvement like scaling and tuning.

### Survey Note: Detailed Analysis of "Assignment05.ipynb"

The Jupyter Notebook "Assignment05.ipynb" implements a machine learning pipeline for predicting customer churn, utilizing logistic regression and decision tree classifiers on the dataset "customer_churn_data.csv." This analysis provides a comprehensive breakdown of the code, following a structured approach similar to previous analyses, and includes all relevant details from the provided content.

#### Introduction to the Notebook

The notebook focuses on a binary classification task: predicting whether a customer will churn (leave the service), with `Churn` as the target variable (Yes/No). It employs two models—logistic regression and decision tree classifier—to achieve this, covering data loading, exploration, preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation. The dataset is clean, with no missing values or duplicates, and is nearly balanced, making it suitable for classification but challenging due to the models' poor performance.

#### Data Loading and Initial Exploration

The notebook begins by importing essential libraries, including `pandas` for data manipulation and `LabelEncoder` from `sklearn.preprocessing` for encoding categorical variables. Additional imports for modeling and evaluation (e.g., `train_test_split`, `LogisticRegression`, `DecisionTreeClassifier`, and metrics like `accuracy_score`) are used later, ensuring a complete machine learning workflow.

The dataset is loaded from "customer_churn_data.csv" into a DataFrame named `data`, with the following characteristics:
- **Size**: 5,880 rows and 21 columns.
- **Columns**: Includes `customerID`, `gender`, `SeniorCitizen`, `Partner`, `Dependents`, `tenure`, `PhoneService`, `MultipleLines`, `InternetService`, `OnlineSecurity`, `OnlineBackup`, `DeviceProtection`, `TechSupport`, `StreamingTV`, `StreamingMovies`, `Contract`, `PaperlessBilling`, `PaymentMethod`, `MonthlyCharges`, `TotalCharges`, and `Churn`.

Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is performed through several steps:
- `data.head()` displays the first five rows, showing the structure, such as:
  ```
  customerID  gender  SeniorCitizen Partner Dependents  tenure ... Churn
  0     CUST0000    Male              0      No        Yes      23 ...    No
  1     CUST0001  Female              0     Yes         No      43 ...   Yes
  2     CUST0002    Male              1      No         No      51 ...   Yes
  3     CUST0003    Male              1      No         No      72 ...    No
  4     CUST0004    Male              1      No         No      25 ...   Yes
  [5 rows x 21 columns]
  ```
- `data.info()` reveals data types (mostly object for categorical, int64 for `SeniorCitizen` and `tenure`, float64 for `MonthlyCharges` and `TotalCharges`) and confirms 5,880 non-null entries per column.
- `data.isna().sum()` and `data.duplicated().sum()` both return 0, confirming no missing values or duplicates.
- `data.shape` outputs (5880, 21), and `data.columns` lists all 21 column names.

This EDA ensures the dataset is clean and ready for preprocessing, with no immediate data quality issues.

#### Data Preprocessing

The preprocessing phase involves several steps to prepare the data for modeling:

1. **Encoding `customerID`**:
   - The `customerID` column, a unique identifier, is encoded using `LabelEncoder`, transforming strings like "CUST0000" to integers (0 to 5,879). This step is unnecessary for modeling, as `customerID` is not predictive, but it was included.

2. **Simplifying Categorical Variables**:
   - Several columns are simplified to reduce categories:
     - `MultipleLines`: "No phone service" and "No" are mapped to "No"; "Yes" remains "Yes".
     - `OnlineSecurity`, `OnlineBackup`, `DeviceProtection`, `TechSupport`, `StreamingTV`, `StreamingMovies`: "No internet service" and "No" are mapped to "No"; "Yes" remains "Yes".
     - `PaymentMethod`: "Electronic check" and "Mailed check" are mapped to "check"; "Bank transfer" and "Credit card" remain unchanged.
   - This simplification reduces complexity, treating "No service" as equivalent to "No" for modeling.

3. **One-Hot Encoding**:
   - All categorical features in `X` (features excluding `Churn`) are one-hot encoded using `pd.get_dummies()`, creating binary columns (e.g., `gender_Male`, `gender_Female`). This expands the feature set to 38 columns, necessary for logistic regression, which requires numerical inputs.

4. **Target Variable Preparation**:
   - `Churn` is mapped to 1 for "Yes" and 0 for "No", converting it into a binary format for classification.

5. **Feature and Target Split**:
   - Features (`X`) include all columns except `Churn`.
   - Target (`Y`) is the `Churn` column (binary: 1 or 0).

6. **Train-Test Split**:
   - The data is split using `train_test_split` with `test_size=0.3` and `random_state=0`, resulting in:
     - Training set: 70% (4,116 samples).
     - Testing set: 30% (1,764 samples).

This preprocessing ensures the data is in a suitable format for machine learning, with categorical variables encoded and the dataset split for model training and evaluation.

#### Model Training and Evaluation

The notebook trains and evaluates two models: logistic regression and decision tree classifier.

1. **Logistic Regression**:
   - **Model**: `LogisticRegression()` with default parameters.
   - **Training**: Fit on `X_train` and `Y_train`.
   - **Evaluation on Training Set**:
     - **Accuracy**: 52.16%.
     - **Confusion Matrix**:
       ```
       [[1178,  906],  # True Negatives, False Positives
        [1063,  969]]  # False Negatives, True Positives
       ```
     - **Classification Report**:
       ```
                 precision  recall  f1-score  support
        0         0.53      0.57    0.54      2084
        1         0.52      0.48    0.50      2032
       accuracy                        0.52      4116
       ```
   - **Evaluation on Test Set**:
     - **Accuracy**: 48.24%.
     - **Note**: The notebook incorrectly re-evaluates the training set for confusion matrix and classification report for the test set, but the test accuracy is correctly reported.

2. **Decision Tree Classifier**:
   - **Model**: `DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=5)`.
   - **Training**: Fit on `X_train` and `Y_train`.
   - **Evaluation on Training Set**:
     - **Accuracy**: 54.25%.
     - **Classification Report**:
       ```
                 precision  recall  f1-score  support
        0         0.56      0.48    0.52      2084
        1         0.53      0.60    0.57      2032
       accuracy                        0.54      4116
       ```
   - **Note**: Test set evaluation is not provided in the notebook.

The evaluation metrics indicate poor performance for both models, with accuracies barely above random guessing (50% for a balanced binary classification problem).

#### Performance Analysis

The models' low performance suggests several underlying issues:
- **Logistic Regression**: Training accuracy (52.16%) and test accuracy (48.24%) are low, with a drop indicating poor generalization. Precision, recall, and F1-scores (around 0.50-0.54) show mediocre performance across both classes.
- **Decision Tree**: Training accuracy (54.25%) is slightly better, with higher recall for class 1 (0.60) but lower precision (0.53), suggesting more false positives for churn predictions. However, test set evaluation is missing, limiting generalization assessment.
- **Class Balance**: The training set has 2,084 "No" (0) and 2,032 "Yes" (1), indicating a nearly balanced dataset, so poor performance is not due to severe class imbalance.

Research suggests that such low accuracies may stem from unscaled numerical features (e.g., `tenure`, `MonthlyCharges`, `TotalCharges`), lack of feature selection, and default model parameters, which could be improved with scaling and tuning.

#### Potential Issues and Improvements

The notebook's approach has several areas for enhancement:
1. **Feature Scaling**: Numerical features are not scaled, which can affect logistic regression performance. Applying `StandardScaler` or `MinMaxScaler` could help.
2. **Feature Selection**: Including all features, including potentially irrelevant ones like `customerID`, may introduce noise. Feature importance analysis or correlation checks could identify relevant features.
3. **Multicollinearity**: Features like `OnlineSecurity`, `OnlineBackup`, etc., may be correlated, impacting logistic regression. Variance inflation factor (VIF) analysis could address this.
4. **Model Tuning**: Both models use default parameters; tuning hyperparameters (e.g., `C` for logistic regression, `max_depth` for decision tree) via grid search could improve performance.
5. **Advanced Models**: Simple models may not capture complex patterns; exploring ensemble methods like Random Forest or Gradient Boosting (e.g., XGBoost) could yield better results.
6. **Evaluation**: The notebook lacks test set evaluation for the decision tree and has errors in logistic regression evaluation. Proper test set evaluation and cross-validation are recommended.
7. **Feature Engineering**: No new features are created; creating ratios (e.g., tenure-to-charge) or aggregating service usage could enhance predictive power.

#### Conclusion

The Jupyter Notebook "Assignment05.ipynb" implements a customer churn prediction pipeline using logistic regression and decision tree classifiers on "customer_churn_data.csv." It covers data loading, cleaning, preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation, but both models perform poorly, with accuracies around 48-54%. The dataset is clean and nearly balanced, suggesting that unscaled features, lack of tuning, and potential multicollinearity are key issues. To improve, scaling numerical features, selecting relevant features, tuning models, and exploring advanced classifiers are recommended, along with ensuring proper test set evaluations for robust performance assessment.

This analysis provides a comprehensive overview, ensuring all details from the notebook are covered, and aligns with the user's request for a detailed analysis in the same style as previous reports.
